# Active Suspension
Active suspension system for a 1/10th scale RC car as a rollover prevention system.
This project uses a microcontroller (Arduino Nano), a MPU6050 gyroscope module, and x4 20kg servos.
Most of the parts are 3D printed using PLA with Creality Ender 3 SE and designed using Onshape CAD.
The test car used is Remo Hobby 1/10th scale crawler.
